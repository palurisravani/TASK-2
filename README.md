Overview of the Project Project: Temperature and Humidity Monitoring with DHT Sensor Interface a DHT sensor with an Arduino to measure temperature and humidity. Display the readings on an LCD screen or serial monitor.

Project Overview This project will interface a DHT sensor with an Arduino board to measure temperature and humidity. The measured values will be displayed on either the serial monitor or an LCD screen. The DHT sensor is widely used for simple temperature and humidity measurement, with models like DHT11 and DHT22 being commonly used. The system can be expanded to include additional features like alarms, data logging, or remote monitoring.

Components Required Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano, or Mega) DHT11 or DHT22 sensor 16x2 LCD display (optional for showing readings) Use an I2C module for easy interfacing. Jumper wires Breadboard 10kÎ© potentiometer (for LCD contrast adjustment) (Optional) USB cable and a computer for serial monitoring

Steps to Test the System Assemble the circuit as per the connections. Upload the code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE. Open the Serial Monitor (set to 9600 baud) to view temperature and humidity readings. Observe the readings displayed on the LCD screen (if connected).

Conclusion By following these detailed steps, you can build a robust temperature and humidity monitoring system using an Arduino and the DHT sensor. The system can be extended further for real-world applications such as in greenhouse management, weather stations, or environmental monitoring.
